[ ] I am using the latest version of calibre to report this bug, which is: 
[ ] I am using an official calibre release, not one from a third party (e.g. your Linux distro, Flatpak, Chocolatey package, Homebrew, etc.)
[ ] I am using the latest version of this plugin, which is: 
[ ] I have installed the Scramble Epub plugin (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=267998) and will attach a **scrambled** copy of the book I'm having problems with.
[ ] If this is a conversion bug, I will also attach a **scrambled** copy of the converted book.

- My operating system is:
  - If Windows 10, I have/have not enabled Windows' beta support for Unicode (see https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3988195&postcount=2052)
  - If Windows 10, does this bug also reproduce with beta Unicode support both enabled and disabled, or does it only reproduce in one scenario?
- I have characters in the path to my calibre library or to a book in calibre which has non-ASCII characters: yes/no
