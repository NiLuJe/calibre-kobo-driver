# Description

Describe your requested new feature, or feature enhancement, in as much detail
as you can. If your proposed change involves book conversion and you can show
where in a book it would be useful, install the Scramble Epub plugin (see
https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=267998), attach a scrambled
KePub book, and describe where in the book I should look and what you expect
the result should be.

## Which plugins

plugins, and if you think it might be useful to relatively few people or to a
lot of people and why.
